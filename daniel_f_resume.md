# Daniel Ferreira
I have 20 years in advanced analytics, spanning industries such as Adtech, Renewable Energy, Marketing Research and Statistical Consulting and Teaching. I’ve worked at companies like Meta, SAS, DSD Renewables and Nielsen. Most recently, I adopted a workflow using VSCode, Git, Python, and SQL, but I also have experience with SAS, R, Power BI, and Tableau. My teaching experience has honed my presentation skills, consulting and teaching have provided me with strong theoretical knowledge, my roles at Meta and DSD Renewables have given me hands-on analytical expertise, and as a manager at DSD Renewables, I honed my strategic thinking skills. I am seeking a senior or management role in data science. Please find below my target and qualifications:

## Work Experience 
- **DSD Renewables** - Jan 2024 to Nov 2024 - Data Scientist / Data Scientist Manager: DSD Renewables is a Solar Energy Development Company where I led a team of four data scientists and engineers focused on developing solar energy data solutions. Our projects spanned financial modeling, input analysis, and plant performance management. I conducted analyses of inverter brand comparisons, developed new energy production models, automated plant performance review processes, and delivered recurring presentations to large audiences on fleet performance. Additionally, I oversaw team initiatives in energy forecasting, customer savings analysis, timeline and budget estimation, and the creation of new analytical workflows. I worked to remove barriers for my team, drive the adoption of new methods, and ensure the successful execution of our projects. My main tools were SQL, Git and Python. My methods included statistical testing, regressions, KNN, Random Forest and bayesian simulations.

- **Meta / Facebook** - Aug 2016 - Jul 2023 - Consumer Researcher / Research Scientist / Data Scientist: My time at Meta can be divided into two distinct roles:
    - Consumer Researcher:
Starting in São Paulo, Brazil, I was responsible for conducting impactful research for Latin America and representing the global research team in the region. I led studies on topics such as TV consumption, Facebook video engagement, holiday season behaviors, and e-commerce purchases. As the global team representative, I presented research findings to large audiences across multiple countries, including the USA, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, and Guatemala, and collaborated with the global team to plan the research agenda. After two years in LATAM, I relocated to the USA, where my focus shifted more toward hands-on research. I contributed insights across various products, such as Instagram Stories and Facebook Groups. Using tools like R, Tableau, Presto, Hive, and Unidash, I analyzed log data and managed third-party survey analyses.

    - Research Scientist / Data Scientist:
Following a reorganization, my team joined the Ads Product organization, where I concentrated on understanding product performance. This role offered more exposure to source control tools, causal inference methods, and randomized experiments. I tested products such as Polling Ads, Branded Content Ads, and Facebook Rewards. Leveraging R, Python, and SQL, I applied methods like random forests to identify key predictors of product success. Additionally, I validated eye-tracking methods, testing various lab devices to measure attention on ads, further enhancing Meta's understanding of ad effectiveness.
