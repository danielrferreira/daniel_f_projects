## Work Experience 
- **DSD Renewables** - Jan 2024 to Nov 2024 - Data Scientist / Data Scientist Manager: DSD Renewables is a Solar Energy Development Company where I led a team of four data scientists and engineers focused on developing solar energy data solutions. Our projects spanned financial model input analysis, and plant performance management. I conducted analyses of inverter brand comparisons, developed new energy production models, automated plant performance review processes, and delivered recurring presentations to large audiences on fleet performance. Additionally, I oversaw team initiatives in energy forecasting, customer savings analysis, timeline and budget estimation, and the creation of new analytical workflows. I worked to remove barriers for my team, drive the adoption of new methods, and ensure the successful execution of our projects. My main tools were SQL, Git and Python. My methods included Statistical Testing, Regressions, KNN, Random Forest and Monte Carlo Markov Chain.

- **Meta / Facebook** - Aug 2016 - Jul 2023 - Consumer Researcher / Research Scientist / Data Scientist: My time at Meta can be divided into two distinct roles:
    - Consumer Researcher:
Starting in São Paulo, Brazil, I was responsible for conducting relevant research for Latin America and representing the global research team in the region. I led studies on topics such as TV consumption, Facebook video engagement, holiday season behaviors, and e-commerce purchases. As the global team representative, I presented research findings to large audiences across multiple countries, including the USA, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, and Guatemala, and collaborated with the global team to plan the research agenda. After two years in LATAM, I relocated to the USA, where my focus shifted more toward hands-on research. I contributed insights across various products, such as Instagram Stories and Facebook Groups. Using tools like R, Python, Tableau, Presto, Hive, and Unidash, I analyzed log data and managed third-party survey analyses.

    - Research Scientist / Data Scientist:
Following a reorganization, my team joined the Ads Product organization, where I concentrated on understanding product performance. This role offered more exposure to source control tools, causal inference methods, and randomized experiments. I tested products such as Polling Ads, Branded Content Ads, and Facebook Rewards. Leveraging R, Python, and SQL, I applied methods like random forests to identify key predictors of product success. Additionally, I validated eye-tracking methods, testing various lab devices to measure attention on ads, further enhancing Meta's understanding of ad effectiveness.

- **Interview Kickstart** - Jul 2023 - present -  Machine Learning Mentor: I have a part time job on weekends teaching Linear Algebra, Regression and Classification Algorithms classes for Machine Learning course at Interview Kickstart. Main tool is Python notebooks.

- **FIA** - Jul 2012 - Dec 2018 - Teacher: Fundação Instituto Administração (FIA) is a Brazilian post-graduate institution offering courses in Data Mining, Statistics, Big Data, and Machine Learning. I first joined FIA in 2012 as an assistant teacher for the Data Mining course. Upon completing the program, I was invited to become a visiting professor, a role I held while simultaneously working at SAS and Facebook.
    - Courses/Programs: Post Graduation in Analysis of Data and Data Mining, MBA in Analysis of Big Data, Specialization in Big Data Analysis.
    - Classes: Hypothesis Tests, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Time Series (ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing and others), Neural Networks, Cluster Analysis, Market Basket Analysis, Discriminant Analysis, Principal Components Analysis, Data Visualization, Exploratory Analysis, Regression Analysis using Big Data, Market Basket Analysis, Text Mining. SAS Client Tools (Enterprise Guide, Enterprise Miner and Forecast Studio), SAS Programming.   

- **SAS** - Feb 2010 - Aug 2016 - Technical Support Consultant - Instructor - Statistical Consultant: At SAS, I held three different roles, all centered around statistical consulting. My work involved projects such as fraud prevention through statistical modeling, demand forecasting, and price optimization to maximize revenue. As an instructor, I traveled across Brazil, teaching statistics and SAS software to approximately 2,000 clients. In 2023, I collaborated with the Brazilian SAS office on a four-week training project, delivering SAS Enterprise Guide instruction tailored to the needs of a Brazilian government branch. During my time at SAS, I actively participated in numerous training programs, earned four professional certifications, and gained invaluable international work experience in both the United States and Colombia.

- **Claro** - Oct 2019 - Feb 2010 - Business Analyst: I gained experience in the telecommunications industry, focusing on developing and monitoring quality performance indicators. During this time, I utilized tools such as VBA, Excel, and SQL, which allowed me to strengthen my skills in data analysis and drive process improvements.

- **Nielsen** - Dec 2006 - Oct 2009 - Statistical Analyst: I began as an intern and transitioned into a full-time role in the Statistics Department, where I contributed to developing and delivering training programs on sampling methods. Additionally, I provided analytical support to address clients' statistical needs, working extensively with SAS codes, VBA, and marketing research techniques, particularly in the consumer packaged goods (CPG) sector.

- **Hospital de Clínicas - UNICAMP** - Mar 2006 - Dec 2006 - Statistical Intern: In this role, I contributed to analyses that supported the medical team and managed patient satisfaction surveys. My responsibilities included designing and implementing questionnaires, conducting survey analytics and randomized experiments.

- **Itaú Unibanco** - Jun 2005 - Dec 2005 - Statistical Intern: I led a project utilizing Markov Chains to estimate the probabilities of customers' next status transitions. Based on the assumption that "what happens next depends only on previous state," we calculated probabilities for the next client status. These estimations were subsequently used as priors for advanced predictive models, improving their accuracy and reliability.

## Tools
- Python: I initially had some exposure to Python during my time at Meta, but in July 2023, I made a deliberate decision to transition from R to Python as my primary programming language. Since then, Python has been my main tool, and I have been using it extensively in my work. I use pandas, numpy, sklearn, seaborn and matplotlib. You can find some of my code in my [pySETTV repository](https://github.com/danielrferreira/pySETTV). (Or in the other folders of this repository)
- SQL language: Since 2006, I have relied on SQL for querying databases, performing joins, and creating aggregations. I have worked with PostgreSQL, MySQL, Hive, Presto, and PROC SQL (SAS).
- Git: More recently, at DSD, I adopted a more efficient workflow by integrating VS Code with Git. I still have basic source control knowledge.
- R: Primary programming language from 2016 to 2023; still used occasionally for specific statistical methods.
- SAS Programming: Certified as an Advanced Programmer in 2011.
- SAS Enterprise Guide: Worked extensively with SAS Enterprise Guide from 2010 to 2016; recently led a 4-week training program for a Brazilian government branch.
- SAS Enterprise Miner: Certified by SAS Institute in 2010 and 2016.
- Tableau: Developed dashboards at Meta (2017–2018).
- Power BI: Created a comprehensive dashboard at DSD (2024) to track Return-to-Service time after outages, integrating data from PostgreSQL, Excel, and SharePoint.
- Qualtrics: Hands-on experience with the platform at both Meta and DSD.
- Microsoft Excel: While VBA is no longer a focus to me, Excel remains a go-to tool for quick visualizations and formatting deliverables.
- C++: Gained basic knowledge through recreational Arduino projects.

## Languages
- Fluent: English and Portuguese
- Basic: Spanish

## Code Repositories
- Some random fun codes I created while studying Python: [py_play](https://github.com/danielrferreira/py_play/blob/main/readme.md)
- My translation to python of some of the methods I used in my career: [pySETTV](https://github.com/danielrferreira/pySETTV). I still have to make it better by using more class objects.
