# Sample Codes

Random collection of codes that I did most recently.

- [Cluster Analysis](https://github.com/danielrferreira/daniel_f_projects/tree/main/sample_codes/Cluster%20Analysis): A simple k-means cluster of baseball players
- [Model Comparison](https://github.com/danielrferreira/daniel_f_projects/tree/main/sample_codes/Model%20Comparison): This is a port of some visualizations I saw in other softwares. The code helps compare multiple models based on a varieaty of fit statistics and graphs.
- [Exploratory Aid](https://github.com/danielrferreira/daniel_f_projects/blob/main/sample_codes/EA_AID/spotify_eda.ipynb): Something I created to help me explore tables. Univariate and Bivariate analysis depending on type of collumn.
- [Music App](https://github.com/danielrferreira/daniel_f_projects/blob/main/sample_codes/music_app): First version of a Streamlit App that show music based on your mood.
