# Sample Codes

Random collection of codes that I did most recently.

Analytical Code:
    - [Cluster Analysis](sample_codes/Cluster%20Analysis): A simple k-means cluster of baseball players
    - [Model Comparison](sample_codes/Model%20Comparison): This is a port of some visualizations I saw in other softwares. The code helps compare multiple models based on a varieaty of fit statistics and graphs.
    - [Exploratory Aid](sample_codes/Exploratory%20Aid): Something I created to help me explore tables. Univariate and Bivariate analysis depending on type of collumn.
